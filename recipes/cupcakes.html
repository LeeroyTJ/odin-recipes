        <h2><em>Ingredients</em></h2>
        <ul id="txt">
            <li>1 ½ cups all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1 tsp baking powder</li>
            <li>½ tsp baking soda</li>
            <li>½ tsp salt</li>
            <li>½ cup unsalted butter, room temperature</li>
            <li>1 cup granulated sugar</li>
            <li>2 large eggs, room temperature</li>
            <li>2 tsp vanilla extract</li>
            <li>½ cup whole milk</li>
            <li>Whipped cream</li>
            <li>Sprinkles</li>
        </ul>

        <h2><em>Steps</em></h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat your oven to 350°F (180°C). Line a muffin tin with cupcake liners.</li>
            <li>In a medium-sized bowl, whisk together the flour, baking powder and salt.</li>
            <li>In a large bowl, cream together the butter and sugar until light and fluffy. Add the eggs, one at a time, beating well after each addition. Stir in the vanilla extract.</li>
            <li>Add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients in three batches, alternating with the milk, beginning and ending with the dry ingredients. Mix until just combined.</li>
            <li>Fill each cupcake liner about two-thirds full with the batter. Bake for 20-25 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center of a cupcake comes out clean.</li>
            <li>Remove the cupcakes from the oven and let them cool completely on a wire rack.</li>
            <li>Once the cupcakes are cool, use a piping bag fitted with a star tip to pipe whipped cream onto the top of each cupcake.</li>
            <li>Sprinkle the tops of the cupcakes with your favorite sprinkles.</li>
            <li>Serve and enjoy!</li>
        </ol>
