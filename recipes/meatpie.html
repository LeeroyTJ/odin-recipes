        <h2><em>Steps</em></h2>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Prepare the filling:</strong></li>
            <ul>
                <li>In a skillet or frying pan, heat the vegetable oil over medium heat.</li>
                <li>Add the chopped onions and minced garlic, sautéing until the onions become translucent and fragrant.</li>
                <li>Stir in the minced meat and cook until browned and fully cooked.</li>
                <li>Add the diced potatoes and carrots, stirring well to combine.</li>
                <li>Season the mixture with curry powder, thyme, paprika or cayenne pepper, salt, and pepper. Adjust the seasoning according to your taste.</li>
                <li>Cook the filling until the vegetables are tender but not mushy. Once done, set the filling aside to cool.</li>
            </ul>
            <li><strong>Prepare the pastry:</strong></li>
            <ul>
                <li>In a large mixing bowl, combine the all-purpose flour, baking powder, and salt.</li>
                <li>Add the cold, cubed butter into the dry ingredients and rub them together with your fingertips until the mixture resembles breadcrumbs.</li>
                <li>Gradually add cold water, a few tablespoons at a time, and mix until the dough comes together. Be careful not to overwork the dough.</li>
                <li>Form the dough into a ball, wrap it in plastic wrap, and refrigerate for about 30 minutes to firm up.</li>
            </ul>
            <li><strong>Assemble the Meat Pies:</strong></li>
            <ul>
                <li>Preheat your oven to 180°C (350°F) and line a baking sheet with parchment paper.</li>
                <li>On a floured surface, roll out the chilled dough to about 1/8-inch thickness.</li>
                <li>Using a round cookie cutter or a glass, cut out circles of dough (about 4 to 5 inches in diameter).</li>
                <li>Spoon a generous amount of the cooled meat filling onto one half of each dough circle, leaving enough space around the edges to seal.</li>
            </ul>
            <li><strong>Seal and Bake:</strong></li>
            <ul>
                <li>Beat the egg in a small bowl to create an egg wash.</li>
                <li>Brush the edges of the dough circles with the egg wash to help seal the pies.</li>
                <li>Fold the dough over the filling to form a half-moon shape, and press the edges together firmly with your fingers or a fork to seal.</li>
                <li>Place the assembled meat pies on the prepared baking sheet.</li>
                <li>Brush the tops of the pies with the egg wash to give them a shiny, golden finish.</li>
            </ul>
            <li><strong>Bake to Perfection:</strong></li>
            <ul>
                <li>Bake the African Meat Pies in the preheated oven for about 25-30 minutes or until they turn a beautiful golden brown color.</li>
                <li>Once baked, remove them from the oven and let them cool slightly before serving.</li>
            </ul>
        </ol>
